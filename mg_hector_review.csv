"Best features in this segment. Filled with technology. The best price range for the specifications they are providing. This car is something Out of the box in the Indian Market. As this car is the first impression of MG motors in the Indian market they have worked a lot on this. The sunroof which is there is usually in Jaguar or BMW.

"The MG Hector pretty much outsizes everything in its class. Its length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention.

"The car is good on cosmetics but I don't think that you can trust the engine for the long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to Indian road conditions.
