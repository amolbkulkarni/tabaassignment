"Kia Seltos is too overpriced and reason just some cosmetic features which don't matter much. Creta has got a better feel when driving, Creta is much smoother and has better suspensions.

"Kia Seltos is a total disappointment for AMT buyers as HTX & GTX variant costs 18-18.5lakh on-road Mumbai (HTK+ variant Doesn't justify its 15lakh on-road Mumbai price tag). Better to opt for Creta AMT & save a lakh or wait for Tata harrier AMT & save some funds meanwhile.

"Don't just go by books and promises. I seriously doubt automatic versions of Kia Seltos as mileage claimed versus actual performance may have a huge difference. I suspect that diesel won't give more than 10-11 km/l and petrol won't go beyond 9 km/l.
